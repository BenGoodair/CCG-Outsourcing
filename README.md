# CCG-Outsourcing
A repository for underlying code behind the upcoming paper, co-authored with [Aaron Reeves](https://aaronreeves.org/): Is the outsourcing of healthcare services to the private sector associated with higher mortality rates? An observational analysis of ‘creeping privatisation’ in England’s Clinical Commissioning Groups, 2013-2020.

The entire paper is written in RMarkdown with all data required for reproducibility posted in the data folder of this repository. In theory anyone should be able to download 'outsourcing_and_mortality.Rmd' and reproduce all the analyses in the manuscript without any additional files.

Please get in touch with me at benjamin.goodair@spi.ox.ac.uk if you would like to discuss anything from the paper or code published in this repository.

The main raw data source of this paper is available from:

And I am very grateful to the support and guidance of [Charles Rahal](https://crahal.github.io/) in the development of this paper.
