# CCG-Outsourcing
A repository for underlying code behind the upcoming paper, co-authored with [Aaron Reeves](https://aaronreeves.org/): Is the outsourcing of healthcare services to the private sector associated with higher mortality rates? An observational analysis of ‘creeping privatisation’ in England’s Clinical Commissioning Groups, 2013-2020.

The main data source of this paper is available from:

[Rahal, Charles & Mohan, John, 2022. "The Role of the Third Sector in Public Health Service Provision: Evidence from 25,338 heterogeneous procurement datasets," SocArXiv t4x52, Center for Open Science.](https://ideas.repec.org/p/osf/socarx/t4x52.html)

And I am very grateful to the support and guidance of [Charles Rahal](https://crahal.github.io/) in the development of this paper.
